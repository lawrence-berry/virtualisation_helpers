# Virtualbox Vvirtualisation helpers

# To Setup MacOS VM

See https://github.com/AlexanderWillner/runMacOSinVirtualBox, this will automatically create
a Virtualbox machine image based upon the Mojave installer, which you need to 
d/l manually via the app store, then press Command-Q on your keyboard to quit the installer.

Then run the installer from the page above: You need to have some software components installed 
on your machine (VirtualBox, VirtualBox Extension Pack, xz, awk). If you've installed http://brew.sh, 
the script will install these automatically. Otherwise, you need to install them manually.
